        <p>Jeera rice is literally cumin rice, and a favorite way to prepare rice throughout India and South Asia. A wonderfully and subtly flavored rice that enhances the flavor of many a dull meal!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon cumin seeds, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1 cup dry basmati rice</li>
            <li>1 ¾ cups water</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>

        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the oil in a medium size saucepan over a medium-high heat. Drop in the cumin seeds, and cook until they splutter. Do not allow the cumin seeds to burn or become really dark brown in color. Add the rice and fry it in the oil for about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Add the water and salt and bring to a boil. Once the water is boiling, reduce the heat to low and cover the saucepan. Cook the rice for approximately 15 minutes. If you feel the rice is getting burnt near the base of the pan as it cooks, one trick is to place the saucepan on another flat pan or griddle which is directly on the flame. Toss with a fork.</li>
